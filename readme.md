# What is RuralDevOps?
---
- It is the rural development opportunity that is now in-demand (thanks, i guess) due to novel coronavirus and the increased interest in social distancing. 
- It is the [USDA Rural Development Opportunity](https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services "List of programs & Services by USDA")
- It is the **opportunity** to deliver broadband to rural areas of North America, not unlike the work [facebook](https://connectivity.fb.com/rural-access/) is doing; plus [SpaceX](https://spacex.com) and the [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) program, plus [State](https://broadband.georgia.gov/) and [federal governments](https://www.usda.gov/broadband) are working on. 
- It is a place for people (not unlike myself @Dial-Stephanie) to come to and not be overwhelmed or intimidated by emerging technologies, but hopefully supported and encouraged by the peole who help make the web a better place; here on [GitHub](https://github.com/ruraldevops "cicrular link back to this repo".)
- It is a place to share resources on rural development.
- It is an all-inclusive attempt at making US sustainable once more.

## What is my problem? 
---
Everything that is this current digital transformation. Not being intimidated or afraid of the technologies, but coming to understand it and improve my learning and development. Not just for myself, but my community. And kids. As I don't want my boys to have anything but the best opportunity possible afforded to them. Realizing that I was raised in Jackson, Georgia (population 4,999) while loving everything (well most everything) about rural living, I failed to notice the importance of remaining tech savvy. Pretty much since Oregon Trail and the Snake game on the Nokia phones. 

I am not alone. Theirs entire communities, counties, and regions in a similar situtation. And the 'gap' that is, is not closing. It's widening. Especially with the rocket-launch from COVID-19. 

## What is the opportunity? 
---
Well for starters, helping someone like me, if your in the IT industry and workin on the gap, I'm told user feedback, and use-case studies are the best way to `iterate` and further develop this tecnologies. So, here I am. Feel free to reach out. Or get in touch with my [IT man](https://oudcollective.github.io/Qualitative-Self "wannabe IT man, struggling with further proficiency himself, while being a boot-strapped entity in partnership to develop a shared dream; sustainable living in rural Georgia")
